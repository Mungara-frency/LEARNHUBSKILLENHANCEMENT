# Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

CI/CD is a cornerstone of effective DevOps, focusing on the automation of code integration, testing, and deployment.

## What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

- Developers merge code changes into a shared repository frequently.
- Automated builds and tests verify every change.
- Reduces integration issues and delivers quality code faster.

**Popular CI Tools:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI.

## What is Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)?

- **Continuous Delivery**: Automated delivery of code to a staging or production environment after passing tests.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Every change that passes automated tests is deployed automatically to production.

**Popular CD Tools:** Spinnaker, ArgoCD, GitLab CI/CD.

## Common Pipeline Stages

1. *Build*: Compile and check code
2. *Test*: Automated unit and integration tests
3. *Deploy*: Ship code to production

CI/CD bridges the gap between development and operations, ensuring faster and safer releases.
