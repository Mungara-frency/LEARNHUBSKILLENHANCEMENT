        explanation:
            "The HOC checks the isVisible prop. When isVisible is false, it returns the fallback div instead of rendering the wrapped component. The Content component never receives the props in this case.",

        explanation:

        explanation:
            "The Counter component renders: 1) Once on initial mount, 2) Once when count changes from 0 to 1 (first click), 3) Once when count changes from 1 to 2 (second click). Each state change in the HOC triggers a re-render of the wrapped component.",
