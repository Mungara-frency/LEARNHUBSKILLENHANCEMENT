- A high-level language, used in web development, data science, automation, AI and more.
- Known for its readability, which means code is easier to write, understand and maintain.
- Backed by library support, so we don’t have to build everything from scratch, there’s probably a library that already does what we need.

## Why to Learn Python?
- Requires fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages.
- Provides Libraries / Frameworks like Django, Flask, Pandas, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn and many more for Web - 
- Development, AI/ML, Data Science and Data Analysis
- Cross-platform, works on Windows, Mac and Linux without major changes.
- Used by top tech companies like Google, Netflix and NASA.
- Many Python coding job opportunities in Software Development, Data Science and AI/ML.
