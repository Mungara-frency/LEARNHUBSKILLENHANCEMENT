## üü¢ Simple Projects  

### Crypto Wallet Simulator
<details>
  <summary>Crypto Wallet Simulator</summary>

  **Description:**  
  Build a simple wallet interface where users can generate a wallet address, view balance (mock data), and send/receive tokens.  

  **How to Build:**  
  - Use libraries like **ethers.js** or **web3.js** to generate Ethereum wallet addresses.  
  - Simulate transactions with dummy data (no real blockchain needed at this stage).  
  - Display balance, transaction history, and allow ‚Äúsend/receive‚Äù interactions.

  <summary>Blockchain Voting System</summary>

  **Description:**  
  A secure voting app where each vote is recorded on a blockchain (mock or testnet).  

  **How to Build:**  
  - Define a smart contract to store candidates and votes.  
  - Ensure that each wallet address can only vote once.  
  - Create a frontend where users can connect wallets (e.g., with MetaMask).  
  - Show results in real time using contract state.
